### 请求日志格式

HTTP 请求日志由 synapse 写入（详情见 `synapse/http/site.py` ）。

请参阅以下内容，了解如何解码默认日志配置中可用的密集数据。

```

| Part  | Explanation |
| ----- | ------------ |
| AAAA  | Timestamp request was logged (not received) |
| BBBB  | Logger name (`synapse.access.(http\|https).<tag>`, where 'tag' is defined in the [`listeners`](../configuration/config_documentation.md#listeners) config section, normally the port) |
| CCCC  | Line number in code |
| DDDD  | Log Level |
| EEEE  | Request Identifier (This identifier is shared by related log lines)|
| FFFF  | Source IP (Or X-Forwarded-For if enabled) |
| GGGG  | Server Port |
| HHHH  | Federated Server or Local User making request (blank if unauthenticated or not supplied).<br/>If this is of the form `@aaa:example.com|@bbb:example.com`, then that means that `@aaa:example.com` is authenticated but they are controlling `@bbb:example.com`, e.g. if `aaa` is controlling `bbb` [via the admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#login-as-a-user). |
| IIII  | Total Time to process the request |
| JJJJ  | Time to send response over network once generated (this may be negative if the socket is closed before the response is generated)|
| KKKK  | Userland CPU time |
| LLLL  | System CPU time |
| MMMM  | Total time waiting for a free DB connection from the pool across all parallel DB work from this request |
| NNNN  | Total time waiting for response to DB queries across all parallel DB work from this request |
| OOOO  | Count of DB transactions performed |
| PPPP  | Response body size |
| QQQQ  | Response status code<br/>Suffixed with `!` if the socket was closed before the response was generated.<br/>A `499!` status code indicates that Synapse also cancelled request processing after the socket was closed.<br/> |
| RRRR  | Request |
| SSSS  | User-agent |
| TTTT  | Events fetched from DB to service this request (note that this does not include events fetched from the cache) |

如果有多个慢速数据库查询并行运行，MMMM / NNNN 可以大于 IIII。

某些操作可能会导致多个相同的 http 请求，这些请求将返回相同的数据，但只有第一个请求会在 `KKKK` / `LLLL` / `MMMM` / `NNNN` / `OOOO` 中报告时间/事务 - 其他请求将等待第一个查询返回响应，并将与第一个请求同时返回，但处理时间非常短。
